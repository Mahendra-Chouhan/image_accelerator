	st.info("Image segmentation is a commonly used technique in digital image processing and \
		analysis to partition an image into multiple parts or regions, often based on the \
		characteristics of the pixels in the image. Image segmentation could involve \
		separating foreground from background, or clustering regions of pixels based on \
		similarities in color or shape. For example, a common application of image segmentation \
		in medical imaging is to detect and label pixels in an image or voxels of a 3D volume \
		that represent a tumor in a patientâ€™s brain or other organs.")
